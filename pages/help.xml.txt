        <p>EC-Support is a collection of procedures to help you interact with Electric Cloud support. It requires both

      <h2>gatherLogs</h2>

        <p>This procedure is a simplified version of the previous one. It
        gathers the logs identically but does not do any call to Zendesk or
        ShareFile. Very useful for users without external internet access.
